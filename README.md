# Per-test logs and CI artifacts

This repository configures a per-test logging fixture used during pytest runs. Logs are written per test to a `test-logs/` directory by default and can be adjusted with environment variables.

## Quick local usage

- Default log directory: `test-logs/` in the repository root.
- Toggle real-time echoing to the terminal during tests:

  ```powershell
  $env:TEST_LOG_ECHO = '1'
  python -m pytest -q tests/unit/path/to/test_file.py::test_name
  ```

- Produce JSON-lines logs (useful for CI ingestion):

  ```powershell
  $env:TEST_LOG_JSON = '1'
  $env:TEST_LOG_REDACT = '1'  # enable simple regex-based redaction
  python -m pytest -q tests/unit/...
  ```

## Env vars

- `TEST_LOG_DIR` ‚Äî base directory for per-test logs (default: `test-logs/`).
- `TEST_LOG_LEVEL` ‚Äî logging level (DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR). Default: INFO.
- `TEST_LOG_JSON` ‚Äî if set to `1` emit JSON-lines per log record.
- `TEST_LOG_REDACT` ‚Äî if set to `1` run a simple regex-based redaction pass over log lines before writing.
- `TEST_LOG_ECHO` ‚Äî if set to `1` also stream logs to stdout in real-time while tests run.
- `TEST_LOG_REDACT_PATTERNS` ‚Äî optional JSON array or semicolon-separated regex list to customize redaction.

## Inspecting logs

Logs are organized by worker id and sanitized nodeid, e.g.: `test-logs/gw0/tests-unit-test_foo.py__test_bar.log`.

## CI integration

There is a GitHub Actions workflow that runs tests and uploads `test-logs/` as an artifact when the test job fails. See `.github/workflows/test-logs-upload.yml`.

If you want different behavior (always upload logs, or change the artifact retention), update the workflow in `.github/workflows/`.

## Contact

If you need changes to the logging format (structured fields, different redaction policy, or alternative storage), open an issue or a PR with proposed changes.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install questionary-extended
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import questionary_extended as qe

# Advanced numeric input with validation
age = qe.number(
    "What's your age?",
    min_value=0,
    max_value=150,
    step=1,
    allow_float=False
).ask()

# Date picker with smart validation
birthday = qe.date(
    "When is your birthday?",
    min_date="1900-01-01",
    max_date="today",
    format="%Y-%m-%d"
).ask()

# Multi-level menu navigation

).ask()

# Color picker with multiple format support
color = qe.color(
    "Choose a theme color:",
    formats=["hex", "rgb", "hsl"],
    preview=True,
    palette=["red", "green", "blue", "yellow", "purple"]

## üèÜ **A+ Grade Testing Architecture**

This project maintains professional-grade testing standards:

- **204 comprehensive tests** with 100% pass rate
- **85%+ code coverage** enforced in CI/CD pipeline
- **Automated quality gates** preventing regression
- **TDD workflow** with pre-commit hooks and coverage tracking

### Quick Testing Commands

```bash
# Windows PowerShell
.\dev.ps1 coverage          # Run tests with A+ coverage validation
.\dev.ps1 validate-aplus    # Complete A+ standards validation

# Unix/Linux/macOS
make coverage               # Run tests with A+ coverage validation
make validate-aplus         # Complete A+ standards validation
```

### PowerShell helper note

The repository ships `dev.ps1`, a PowerShell-first helper script that exposes session-safe functions (for example `Invoke-ModerateTests` and `Ensure-GhOnPath`). Use `.\dev.ps1 test-moderate` to run a focused subset of tests that exercise the questionary/prompt/component/cli code paths on Windows. The script will attempt to ensure the GitHub CLI (`gh`) is discoverable in the current session by prepending common install folders to `$env:PATH` if needed.

If you prefer to run the focused test subset directly, use the following PowerShell-safe command:

```powershell
python -m pytest -q tests/unit -k 'questionary or prompts or component or cli'
```

**Testing Documentation**: See [docs/TESTING_BEST_PRACTICES.md](docs/TESTING_BEST_PRACTICES.md) for complete testing standards and workflow.
