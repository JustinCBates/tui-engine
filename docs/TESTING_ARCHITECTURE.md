**Coverage Ratcheting (Prevent Regression):**



```bash- **Default Timeout**: Configurable via `TEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` env var (default: 5 seconds)- Tests must be hermetic: importing modules should not create real console

# Save current coverage as baseline

python -m coverage report --precision=2 | grep TOTAL | awk '{print $4}' > .coverage_baseline- **Preferred Mechanism**: `pytest-timeout` plugin in `pytest.ini`  sessions, open network connections, or produce non-deterministic side effects.



# In CI, check against baseline- **Fallback**: `pytest_runtest_call` hook with daemon thread timeout- Tests should fail fast and provide clear diagnostics: missing test assets,

current_cov=$(python -m coverage report --precision=2 | grep TOTAL | awk '{print $4}' | sed 's/%//')

baseline_cov=$(cat .coverage_baseline | sed 's/%//')  long-running or hanging tests, and unexpected imports should yield readable

if (( $(echo "$current_cov < $baseline_cov" | bc -l) )); then

  echo "Coverage regression detected: $current_cov% < $baseline_cov%"### Per-Test Logging  error messages.

  exit 1

fi- Per-test logs should be available for debugging and attached to CI artifacts

```

**Goals:**  when failures happen. Developers should be able to see logs in real time

**Pre-commit Hook Standards:**

- Always capture logs to per-test file (`test-logs/{worker}/{safe-nodeid}.log`)  during local runs when desired.

```yaml

repos:- Optional real-time streaming (`TEST_LOG_ECHO=1`)- The architecture should be portable across platforms and working directories

  - repo: local

    hooks:- Replay logs on test failure for immediate debugging context  (Windows PowerShell included), and be easy to copy into other projects.

```- `TEST_LOG_LEVEL` — default logging level (INFO)1. Centralized runtime accessor



### Coverage Improvement Strategy- `TEST_LOG_ECHO` — if '1', stream to stdout in real-time



**Priority-Based Coverage Targeting:**- `TEST_LOG_JSON` — if '1', emit JSON entries for CI systems   - The package exposes a small runtime accessor module (e.g.



1. **prompts_core.py** (33% → 95%): 49 uncovered lines - highest priority     `package._runtime`) with simple functions:

2. **prompts.py** (37% → 95%): 52 uncovered lines - high priority

3. **Core modules** (45-53% → 85%): assembly, state, component - medium priority---     - `get_questionary()` -> returns active questionary object or None



**Coverage Gap Analysis Process:**     - `set_questionary_for_tests(obj)` -> install a test runtime mock



```bash## Development Workflow & TDD     - `clear_questionary_for_tests()` -> clear the test runtime mock

# 1. Generate coverage report

# 2. Identify priority gaps### Daily Development Workflow     call time rather than creating expensive runtime objects at import time.

   - Tests should either insert a stub into `sys.modules['questionary']` or

```

      real-time visibility.

### API Consistency Standards

```yaml    - `TEST_LOG_JSON` — if '1', emit JSON entries (optional/advanced).

**Component Construction:**

- name: Coverage quality gate  - On teardown, if the test failed (the pytest report object shows failure

```python

# Correct  run: |    in `rep_call.failed`), the fixture emits the log file contents to stdout

component = Component(name="test_comp", component_type="text", message="Enter value:")

    COVERAGE=$(python -m coverage report --precision=2 | grep TOTAL | awk '{print $4}' | sed 's/%//')    surrounded by clear header/footer markers. CI can collect these files as

# Incorrect (legacy)

component = Component(id="test_comp", prompt_type="text", message="Enter value:")    if (( $(echo "$COVERAGE < 85" | bc -l) )); then    artifacts automatically.

```

    )    fi    required for the common case.

    monkeypatch.setattr("module.path.dependency", mock_module)

---## Diagnostic helpers



## Implementation Examples**Pre-commit Hook Standards:**



### Utils Module Success Story- `tests/logging_utils.py` exposes helpers to sanitize nodeids, compute worker



**Achievement**: Boosted from 0% to 94% coverage with 47 comprehensive tests```yaml  ids, and compute default log dirs. These are intentionally tiny and copyable



**Key Success Factors:**repos:  into other projects.

- Comprehensive edge case testing (Unicode, boundaries, empty inputs)

- Real implementation behavior validation vs theoretical expectations  - repo: local

- Property-based testing patterns for robust validation

- Professional test organization with clear documentation    hooks:## Developer UX



**Template Applied:**      - id: coverage-check



```python        name: Coverage Quality Gate (A+ Standard)- Before each test runs, the runner prints a concise line:

class TestUtilitiesCore:

    """Core utility function tests."""        entry: python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-fail-under=85 --cov-report=term-missing -x



    def test_format_number_percentage(self):        language: system  RUNNING <nodeid> (timeout=<n>s)

        """Test percentage formatting with various decimal places."""

        result = format_number(0.856, percentage=True, decimal_places=2)        pass_filenames: false

        assert result == "0.9%"  # Matches actual implementation behavior

        always_run: true  This makes it easy to spot the currently running test in long output.

    def test_parse_color_invalid_input(self):

        """Test graceful handling of invalid color inputs."""        stages: [commit]

        result = parse_color("invalid_color")

        assert result.hex == "#000000"  # Returns default black```- If `TEST_LOG_ECHO=1` is set, logs stream to the terminal in real time.

        assert result.rgb == (0, 0, 0)

```- When a test fails, the test runner prints the per-test log file contents so



### Module Consolidation Examples### Coverage Improvement Strategy  developers can immediately read diagnostics without opening separate files.



**Utils Module Consolidation:**

```

tests/test_utils_core.py        # Basic utilities (date, number, color, text)**Priority-Based Coverage Targeting:**## CI Integration

tests/test_utils_advanced.py    # Progress bars, fuzzy matching, validation

tests/test_utils_integration.py # Integration scenarios and edge cases

```

1. **prompts_core.py** (33% → 95%): 49 uncovered lines - highest priority- CI job should:

**CLI Module Consolidation:**

```2. **prompts.py** (37% → 95%): 52 uncovered lines - high priority  - Set `TEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` to a stricter default for the entire suite

tests/test_cli_commands.py      # Individual CLI command functionality

tests/test_cli_integration.py   # CLI integration and main execution3. **Core modules** (45-53% → 85%): assembly, state, component - medium priority    (e.g., 10s for unit tests) or rely on pytest-timeout plugin configuration.

```

  - On test failure, upload the `test-logs/` directory as job artifacts so

### Property-Based Testing Integration

- **October 2025**: Consolidated from TEST_ARCHITECTURE.md, TESTING_ARCHITECTURE.md, TESTING_BEST_PRACTICES.md, and coverage-workflow.md```

- **Status**: Authoritative testing architecture guide

- **Next Review**: Monthly coverage trend analysis   - The package exposes a small runtime accessor module (e.g.



---### API Consistency Standards     `package._runtime`) with simple functions:



**This testing architecture was established through comprehensive test refactoring in October 2025, successfully reducing test file count by 70% while achieving A+ grade testing excellence. Follow these patterns for all future test development and maintain the high standards established.**     - `get_questionary()` -> returns active questionary object or None

**Component Construction:**     - `set_questionary_for_tests(obj)` -> install a test runtime mock

     - `clear_questionary_for_tests()` -> clear the test runtime mock

```python   - Modules use a thin module-level proxy or call the runtime accessor at

# Correct     call time rather than creating expensive runtime objects at import time.

component = Component(name="test_comp", component_type="text", message="Enter value:")   - Tests should either insert a stub into `sys.modules['questionary']` or

     call `set_questionary_for_tests()` early (fixtures) to control runtime

# Incorrect (legacy)     behavior.

component = Component(id="test_comp", prompt_type="text", message="Enter value:")

```2. Avoid import-time effects



**Mock Patterns:**   - Tests must not cause real `prompt_toolkit` `PromptSession` creation while

     importing code. To guarantee this:

```python     - Real prompt factories are resolved at call-time (lazy factories), and

def test_with_mock(self, monkeypatch):       any code that may touch `prompt_toolkit` is executed inside functions

    """Test with mocked dependencies."""       that can be stubbed in tests.

    mock_module = types.SimpleNamespace(     - Tests use `tests.helpers.setup_questionary_mocks()` which installs a

        method=lambda *a, **k: MockObject("result")       lightweight fake `questionary` object in `sys.modules` and sets the

    )       runtime accessor accordingly.

    monkeypatch.setattr("module.path.dependency", mock_module)

```3. Path validation

   - Tests that load modules directly from file paths must validate those

---     paths early using `tests.helpers.path_utils.ensure_path_exists(path,

required=True)` to fail fast when local files are missing or when the

## Implementation Examples     repository layout differs.



### Utils Module Success Story## Timeouts and Hanging Tests



**Achievement**: Boosted from 0% to 94% coverage with 47 comprehensive tests- Default timeout: configurable via `TEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` env var (default

  conservative value: 5 seconds for unit tests).

**Key Success Factors:**- Preferred mechanism: `pytest-timeout` plugin added to test dependencies and

- Comprehensive edge case testing (Unicode, boundaries, empty inputs)  configured globally in `pytest.ini` when available.

- Real implementation behavior validation vs theoretical expectations- Fallback mechanism: a `pytest_runtest_call` hook that runs tests in a daemon

- Property-based testing patterns for robust validation  thread and fails with a clear timeout message if the test doesn't complete

- Professional test organization with clear documentation  within the timeout. This avoids hanging the entire runner when the plugin is

  not available.

**Template Applied:**- When a timeout occurs, the test harness should print a helpful message and

  — when possible — a stacktrace for where the test got stuck (pytest-timeout

```python  can provide a stack snapshot; the thread-based fallback will report the

class TestUtilitiesCore:  timeout and the test's output).

    """Core utility function tests."""

## Per-test logging

    def test_format_number_percentage(self):

        """Test percentage formatting with various decimal places."""- Goals:

        result = format_number(0.856, percentage=True, decimal_places=2)

        assert result == "0.9%"  # Matches actual implementation behavior  - Always capture logs to a per-test file (`test-logs/{worker}/{safe-nodeid}.log`).

  - Optionally stream logs to stdout in real time (controlled by

    def test_parse_color_invalid_input(self):    `TEST_LOG_ECHO=1`).

        """Test graceful handling of invalid color inputs."""  - When a test fails, replay the per-test log to the terminal so developers

        result = parse_color("invalid_color")    immediately see the context that led to the failure.

        assert result.hex == "#000000"  # Returns default black  - Keep logs structured enough to be ingested by CI systems (JSON option)

        assert result.rgb == (0, 0, 0)    while remaining human-friendly by default.

```

- Mechanics:

### Module Consolidation Examples

  - An autouse pytest fixture configures a `logging.FileHandler` with a

**Utils Module Consolidation:**    formatter and attaches it to the root logger for the duration of the test.

```  - Filenames are sanitized versions of the pytest nodeid. Worker id (xdist)

tests/test_utils_core.py        # Basic utilities (date, number, color, text)    is appended as a directory component to avoid collisions.

tests/test_utils_advanced.py    # Progress bars, fuzzy matching, validation  - Environment toggles:

tests/test_utils_integration.py # Integration scenarios and edge cases    - `TEST_LOG_DIR` — base output folder for logs (default: repo-root/test-logs)

```    - `TEST_LOG_LEVEL` — default logging level (INFO)

    - `TEST_LOG_ECHO` — if '1', also attach a `StreamHandler` to stdout for

**CLI Module Consolidation:**      real-time visibility.

```    - `TEST_LOG_JSON` — if '1', emit JSON entries (optional/advanced).

tests/test_cli_commands.py      # Individual CLI command functionality  - On teardown, if the test failed (the pytest report object shows failure

tests/test_cli_integration.py   # CLI integration and main execution    in `rep_call.failed`), the fixture emits the log file contents to stdout

```    surrounded by clear header/footer markers. CI can collect these files as

    artifacts automatically.

### Property-Based Testing Integration

- XDist and concurrency:

```python  - Per-worker subdirectories avoid inter-process contention.

import pytest  - File-by-file writing is simple and robust; no central logging queue is

from hypothesis import given, strategies as st    required for the common case.



@pytest.mark.property## Diagnostic helpers

@given(st.text(), st.integers(min_value=1, max_value=100))

def test_function_property_based(text_input, width):- `tests/logging_utils.py` exposes helpers to sanitize nodeids, compute worker

    """Property-based test for robust edge case coverage."""  ids, and compute default log dirs. These are intentionally tiny and copyable

    result = target_function(text_input, width)  into other projects.

    assert len(result) <= width  # Property that should always hold

```## Developer UX



---- Before each test runs, the runner prints a concise line:



## Migration & Best Practices  RUNNING <nodeid> (timeout=<n>s)



### Test Consolidation Process  This makes it easy to spot the currently running test in long output.



**Step 1: Analysis Phase**- If `TEST_LOG_ECHO=1` is set, logs stream to the terminal in real time.

1. **Inventory existing tests**: Use `file_search` to find all test files for the module- When a test fails, the test runner prints the per-test log file contents so

2. **Measure baseline coverage**: Run `pytest --cov={module}` to establish current coverage  developers can immediately read diagnostics without opening separate files.

3. **Identify overlaps**: Look for duplicate test scenarios across files

4. **Map test categories**: Group tests by functionality (core/advanced/integration)## CI Integration



**Step 2: Consolidation Phase**- CI job should:

1. **Create new structure**: Generate the three target files with proper class organization  - Set `TEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` to a stricter default for the entire suite

2. **Migrate tests systematically**: Move tests to appropriate categories, removing duplicates    (e.g., 10s for unit tests) or rely on pytest-timeout plugin configuration.

3. **Update imports and mocks**: Ensure all test dependencies are properly imported  - On test failure, upload the `test-logs/` directory as job artifacts so

4. **Fix API consistency**: Align constructor calls and method signatures across tests    maintainers can inspect logs offline.

  - Optionally enable `TEST_LOG_JSON=1` to have logs ingested by structured

**Step 3: Validation Phase**    log analysis systems.

1. **Run consolidated tests**: Verify all tests pass in new structure

2. **Measure final coverage**: Confirm coverage is maintained or improved## Portability and PowerShell

3. **Remove legacy files**: Delete original overlapping test files
