- [ ] ‚ö° **Optimization**
  - Performance tuning and memory management
  - Large form handling optimization
  - Comprehensive test coverage (90%+)
- [ ] üõ°Ô∏è **Reliability**
  - Edge case handling and error resilience
  - Cross-platform compatibility verification
  - Security and input validation review

#### Week 8: Documentation & Launch

- [ ] üìö **Documentation**
  - Complete API documentation with examples
  - Migration guides for questionary users
  - Best practices and design patterns
- [ ] üéâ **Release Preparation**
  - Beta testing and community feedback
  - Final performance benchmarks
  - Release packaging and distribution

**Milestone 4 Success**: Production-ready release with comprehensive documentation and proven stability

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

### Priority 1: Development Environment Setup

1. **Repository Structure**

   ```bash
   # Create the package structure
   mkdir -p src/questionary_extended/{core,integration,events,styling,utils}

   # Set up basic module files
   touch src/questionary_extended/__init__.py
   touch src/questionary_extended/core/{__init__.py,page.py,card.py,assembly.py,component.py,state.py}
   ```

2. **Dependencies Configuration**

   ```toml
   # Add to pyproject.toml
   dependencies = [
       "questionary>=2.0.0",
       "prompt-toolkit>=3.0.0"
   ]
   ```

3. **Testing Framework**

   ```bash
   # Create test structure
   mkdir -p tests/{unit,integration,compatibility}

   # Set up pytest configuration
   ```

### Priority 2: Core Foundation Implementation

1. **Basic Page Class**

   ```python
   # src/questionary_extended/core/page.py
   class Page:
       def __init__(self, title: str):
           self.title = title
           self.components = []
           self.state = PageState()

       def card(self, title: str) -> 'Card':
           # Return Card that chains back to Page

       def run(self) -> dict:
           # Execute questionary flow, return flat results
   ```

2. **State Management**
   ```python
   # src/questionary_extended/core/state.py
   class PageState:
       def __init__(self):
           self._data = {}

       def set(self, key: str, value: any):
           # Handle assembly.field namespacing

       def get(self, key: str, default=None):
           # Retrieve with namespace support
   ```

### Priority 3: First Working Prototype

**Target**: Simple example working by end of week

```python
# Goal: This should work
import questionary_extended as qe

result = qe.Page("Test Configuration")
  .card("Basic Info")
    .text("name")
    .select("type", ["web", "api"])
  .run()

print(result)  # {"name": "MyApp", "type": "web"}
```

## üìä Progress Tracking

### Development Metrics

- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Target 90%+ overall
- [ ] **Performance**: Match questionary baseline for simple forms
- [ ] **Compatibility**: 100% questionary behavior preservation
- [ ] **Documentation**: Complete API coverage with examples

### Quality Gates

1. **Phase 1**: All questionary tests pass unchanged
2. **Phase 2**: Complex conditional logic working reliably
3. **Phase 3**: Responsive layouts adapt correctly across terminal sizes
4. **Phase 4**: Production deployment ready with full documentation

### Risk Monitoring

- **High Risk**: questionary compatibility breaks
- **Medium Risk**: Event system performance issues
- **Low Risk**: Documentation completeness delays

## ü§ù Collaboration & Feedback

### Development Checkpoints

- **Weekly Reviews**: Progress assessment and roadblock resolution
- **Milestone Demos**: Working prototypes for stakeholder feedback
- **Beta Testing**: Community involvement for real-world validation

### Communication Channels

- **Design Reviews**: Architecture decisions and trade-off discussions
- **Technical Issues**: Implementation challenges and solutions
- **User Feedback**: Early adopter experiences and feature requests

## ‚úÖ Ready to Begin Development

The comprehensive design and implementation plan provides:

- **Clear Architecture**: Well-defined component hierarchy and interactions
- **Detailed Roadmap**: 8-week timeline with specific milestones
- **Risk Mitigation**: Proactive identification and handling of challenges
- **Quality Assurance**: Testing strategy ensuring reliability and compatibility

**Next Action**: Begin Phase 1 development with project structure setup and core class implementation.

**Success Criteria**: By Week 2, have a working prototype that demonstrates the core value proposition while maintaining full questionary compatibility.

üöÄ **Let's build questionary-extended!**
