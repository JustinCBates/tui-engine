# Testing Best Practices for A+ Architecture

## üèÜ Overview

This document establishes the **definitive best practices** for maintaining A+ grade testing architecture in the questionary-extended project. These practices were developed during the successful upgrade from A-grade (100% test pass rate) to **A+ grade excellence** achieved in October 2025.

## üìä A+ Grade Standards

### Coverage Requirements

- **Overall Project**: 85%+ coverage minimum for A+ status
- **New Code**: 95%+ coverage required for all additions
- **Modified Code**: Zero coverage regression tolerance
- **Critical Paths**: 100% coverage required

### Quality Gates

- **Test Pass Rate**: 100% (no failing tests allowed)
- **Code Quality**: All linting, formatting, and type checks pass
- **Security**: All security scans clear
- **Performance**: No regression in benchmark tests

## üîÑ Daily Development Workflow

### 1. Pre-Development Assessment

**Before writing any new code:**

```bash
# Windows PowerShell
.\dev.ps1 coverage-report    # Check current baseline
.\dev.ps1 validate-aplus     # Ensure A+ standards maintained

# Unix/Linux/macOS
make coverage-report         # Check current baseline
make validate-aplus         # Ensure A+ standards maintained
```

**Coverage Baseline Check:**

```bash
python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=85
```

### 2. Test-Driven Development (TDD) Process

**Mandatory TDD workflow for all new functionality:**

1. **Write Tests First** - Create comprehensive test suite before implementation
2. **Red Phase** - Verify tests fail appropriately
3. **Green Phase** - Implement minimal code to pass tests
4. **Refactor Phase** - Improve code while maintaining test coverage
5. **Coverage Validation** - Ensure 95%+ coverage for new code

**Example TDD Workflow:**

```bash
# 1. Create test file
touch tests/test_new_feature_comprehensive.py

# 2. Write failing tests
# 3. Run tests to verify they fail
python -m pytest tests/test_new_feature_comprehensive.py -v

# 4. Implement code to make tests pass
# 5. Verify coverage meets A+ standards
python -m pytest tests/test_new_feature_comprehensive.py --cov=src.questionary_extended.new_feature --cov-fail-under=95
```

### 3. Code Quality Validation

**Before every commit:**

```bash
# Automated via pre-commit hooks
pre-commit run --all-files

# Manual validation
.\dev.ps1 lint              # Linting check
.\dev.ps1 type-check        # Type safety validation
.\dev.ps1 security          # Security scan
.\dev.ps1 coverage          # Coverage validation
```

## üèóÔ∏è Test Architecture Patterns

### Three-Tier Organization Standard

For each major module, organize tests into exactly **three files**:

```
tests/test_{module}_core.py         # Basic functionality and fundamental operations
tests/test_{module}_advanced.py     # Error handling, edge cases, complex scenarios
tests/test_{module}_integration.py  # End-to-end workflows and integration testing
```

### Test Class Structure Standard

**Consistent naming and organization:**

```python
"""
Comprehensive test suite for {module}.py
Target: 95%+ coverage with complete edge case handling
"""

import pytest
from src.questionary_extended.{module} import {functions}

class Test{Module}Core:
    """Core functionality tests."""

    def test_{function}_happy_path(self):
        """Test normal operation scenarios."""
        pass

    def test_{function}_edge_cases(self):
        """Test boundary conditions and edge cases."""
        pass

    def test_{function}_error_handling(self):
        """Test exception scenarios and error recovery."""
        pass

class Test{Module}Integration:
    """Integration and workflow tests."""

    def test_{function}_integration_workflow(self):
        """Test complete integration scenarios."""
        pass

# Target: 15-20 tests per module for 95%+ coverage
```

### Property-Based Testing Integration

**For complex validation logic:**

```python
import pytest
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@pytest.mark.property
@given(st.text(), st.integers(min_value=1, max_value=100))
def test_function_property_based(text_input, width):
    """Property-based test for robust edge case coverage."""
    result = target_function(text_input, width)
    assert len(result) <= width  # Property that should always hold
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Automated Quality Enforcement

### CI/CD Pipeline Standards

**Coverage Gates in GitHub Actions:**

```yaml
- name: Coverage quality gate
  run: |
    COVERAGE=$(python -m coverage report --precision=2 | grep TOTAL | awk '{print $4}' | sed 's/%//')
    if (( $(echo "$COVERAGE < 85" | bc -l) )); then
      echo "‚ùå Coverage below A+ standard: ${COVERAGE}% < 85%"
      exit 1
    else  
      echo "‚úÖ A+ Coverage standard maintained: ${COVERAGE}% >= 85%"
    fi
```

**Coverage Regression Prevention:**

```yaml
- name: Coverage regression check
  run: |
    # Compare against baseline and prevent regression
    python scripts/coverage_tracker.py --check-regression
```

### Pre-commit Hook Standards

**Mandatory checks before commit:**

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: coverage-check
        name: Coverage Quality Gate (A+ Standard)
        entry: python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-fail-under=85 --cov-report=term-missing -x
        language: system
        pass_filenames: false
        always_run: true
        stages: [commit]
```

## üìà Coverage Improvement Strategy

### Priority-Based Coverage Targeting

**Current high-impact targets for 85%+ achievement:**

1. **prompts_core.py** (33% ‚Üí 95%): 49 uncovered lines - highest priority
2. **prompts.py** (37% ‚Üí 95%): 52 uncovered lines - high priority
3. **Core modules** (45-53% ‚Üí 85%): assembly, state, component - medium priority

### Coverage Gap Analysis Process

**Systematic improvement workflow:**

```bash
# 1. Generate coverage report
python -m coverage html
# Open htmlcov/index.html for detailed analysis

# 2. Identify priority gaps
python scripts/coverage_tracker.py --analyze

# 3. Create comprehensive test suite for target module
# 4. Validate coverage improvement
python -m pytest tests/test_target_module_comprehensive.py --cov=src.questionary_extended.target_module --cov-report=term-missing

# 5. Ensure overall project coverage improvement
python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-fail-under=85
```

### New Code Coverage Standards

**Enforcement for all new functionality:**

- **Minimum Coverage**: 95% for any new module or function
- **Test Requirements**: Comprehensive edge case coverage
- **Documentation**: All tests must have clear docstrings
- **Integration**: Must include integration test scenarios
