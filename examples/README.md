First working prototype example

This folder contains a minimal, non-interactive prototype demonstrating how
to assemble a Page, Assembly, and Components and write namespaced state into
the PageState object. The script `first_working_prototype.py` is safe to run in
CI because it simulates answers instead of requiring interactive input.

Run:

    python .\examples\first_working_prototype.py

This exercise demonstrates Task 12 (First Working Prototype) in the project's
todo list.
